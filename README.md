# Web development:
This repository is my personal "notebook" on learning web development. The intention is not for this to teach anyone web development, but to be a guide that can be checked whenever I forget something or just need to make sure it is done the right way. Also it will have some projects that will also provide base for future projects, serving as a reminder of how to approach and do some things.

### The basics:
- [Node.js basics](https://github.com/FabricioBattaglia/web/tree/main/node.js)
- [REST API and HTTP basics](https://github.com/FabricioBattaglia/web/tree/main/API-rest)
