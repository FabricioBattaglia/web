# A Change of Face

Due to circumstances beyond my control the material that serves as source to this repository had to be changed. All the knowledge on previous chapters are still very valuable and usable. We might end up using different technologies, but the end goal will still be the same. I will avoid adding things that were already covered before, and that includes projects. I hope everything will end up connecting nicely and that this serves well as the documentation of a journey learning backend web development.
